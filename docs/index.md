## 🤖 Your Dreamfect AI Coach

At the heart of Dreamfect is an **AI-powered coach** that continuously **analyzes your food and workout input** to compute:

- 🍽️ **What you’ve consumed** — calories, protein, carbs, fat  
- 🔥 **What you’ve burned** — through logged workouts and daily activity

<!-- ![Coach Screenshot](assets/coach.png) -->
<!-- <img src="assets/coach.png" alt="Coach Screenshot" width="40%"> -->
<!-- <div style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px; margin: auto;">
  <img id="carousel" src="assets/coach1.png" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;">

  <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px;">
    <button onclick="changeImage(-1)">←</button>
    <button onclick="changeImage(1)">→</button>
  </div>
</div>

<script>
  var images = [
    "assets/coach1.png",
    "assets/coach2.png",
    "assets/coach3.png"
  ];
  var current = 0;
  function changeImage(dir) {
    current = (current + dir + images.length) % images.length;
    document.getElementById("carousel").src = images[current];
  }
</script> -->
<div style="display: flex; gap: 16px;">
  <img src="assets/coach1.png" alt="Coach1 Screenshot" width="48%">
  <img src="assets/coach2.png" alt="Coach2 Screenshot" width="48%">
</div>

But it doesn't stop there.

Dreamfect’s coach understands **context** — not just numbers. When you let the app know how you're feeling — **injured**, **tired**, **energized**, or dealing with a condition like **high cholesterol** — the coach adapts its advice accordingly.

### 🧠 Adaptive Intelligence in Action

Your AI coach responds to your real-life situations with smart, practical recommendations:
- **Feeling sore?** It may suggest active recovery or a stretching session.
- **Low on sleep?** It might recommend energy-boosting foods and lighter movement.
- **Have a health concern?** It factors in your goal (e.g., lower cholesterol) when recommending meals or workouts.

### 🎯 More Than Tracking — It Guides You

Unlike rigid fitness apps, Dreamfect helps you make **better daily decisions**, even when life gets messy.

- Suggests **food swaps** based on your condition or goals  
- Encourages **balanced routines** and healthy habits  
- Learns from your behavior to offer **smarter suggestions** over time

### 💬 Try Saying:
> “I’m recovering from an injury”
